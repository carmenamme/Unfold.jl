Returns a predicted ("y_hat = X*b") `Array`. 

- `uf` is an `<:UnfoldModel`
- `f` is a (vector of) formulas, typically `Unfold.formulas(uf)`, but formulas can be modified e.g. by `effects`.
- `evts` is a (vector of) events, can be `Unfold.events(uf)` to return the (possibly continuous-time) predictions of the model. Can be a custom even


## kwargs:
if `overlap = true` (default), overlap based on the `latency` column of 'evts` will be simulated, or in the case of `!ContinuousTimeTrait` just X*coef is returned. 
if `overlap = false`, predict coefficients without overlap (models with `ContinuousTimeTrait` (=> with basisfunction / deconvolution) only), via `predict_no_overlap`

if `keep_basis` or `exclude_basis` is defined, then `predict_partial_overkap` is called, which allows to selective introduce overlap based on specified (or excluded respective) events/basisfunctions

`epoch_to` and  `epoch_timewindow` currently only defined for partial_overlap, calculated (partial) overlap controlled predictions, but returns them at the specified `epoch_at` event, with the times `epoch_timewindow` in samples

Hint: all vectors can be "single" types, and will be containered in a vector

## Output

- If `overlap=false`, returns a 3D-Array
- If `overlap=true` and `epoch_to=nothing` (default), returns a 2D-array
- If `overlap=true` and `epoch_to!=nothing`, returns a 3D array
